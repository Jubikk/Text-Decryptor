# Text-Decryptor
Hi, My name is Joebeck Andrew F. Gusi from BSCPE 1-5

This program allows you to input an encyrpted text and the program
will decrypt it using the following characters:

( 'a' = *, 'e' = & , 'i' = # , 'o' = + 'u' = ! )

Thank you for using my program!!



Note:
This program was wrtten using python language, before using the program make sure
that you already installed the required application to run the program.
